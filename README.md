# Automatic.Writer
Automatic.Writer is a writing tool for the Automatic.Ink platform. It allows authors to write algorithmic literature using the Automatic.Writing language.

This software, as well as all other work on the Automatic.Ink platform, is currently in Early-Alpha phase of development.

The Automatic.Ink platform was developped by [Raphaël Muñoz](http://www.github.com/aprodabo) & [Douglas Edric Stanley](http://github.com/abstractmachine) for the research project [Écriture mobile](http://www.hesge.ch/head/projet/ecriture-mobile) at the [Geneva University of Art and Design (HEAD –Genève)](http://www.hesge.ch/head/formations-recherche/recherche) with funding from the Réseau de compétences Design et Arts visuels (RCDAV) of the [HES SO](http://www.hes-so.ch).
